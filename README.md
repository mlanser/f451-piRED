# Instructions for f451 Labs SenseMon v1.0.2

## Overview

This application is designed for the *f451 Labs piRED* and *piF451* devices which are both equipped with [Raspberry Pi Sense HAT](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/sense-hat.html) add-ons. The main objective is to continously read environment data (e.g. temperature, barometric pressure, and humidity) from the Sense HAT sensors and then upload the data to the [Adafruit IO service](https://io.adafruit.com).

## Install

This application is not available on PyPi. However, you can still use `pip` to install the module directly from Github (see below).

### Dependencies

This module is dependent on the following libraries:

- [sense-hat](https://pypi.org/project/sense-hat/) â€” only install if you have a physical Sense HAT device
- [adafruit-io](https://pypi.org/project/adafruit-io/) â€” only install if you have an account with the Adafruit IO service

NOTE: You can run this app in demo mode on (almost) any device even without the Sense HAT. It will then create random numbers and can send output to the `logger` when log level is `DEBUG` or when `--debug` flag is used.

### Installing from Github using `pip`

You can use `pip install` to install this module directly from Github as follows:

```bash
$ pip install 'f451-piRED @ git+https://github.com/mlanser/f451-piRED.git'
```

### What's with the name '*f451-piRED*'

The original idea behind this repo was to hold all application running on a particalar Raspberry Pi device â€” piRED â€” in my network. This device has a specific hardware configuration and general "purpose" (i.e. to read and process environment data).

So, if/when I add more applications to this device, they'll also be added to this repo and will show up as 'scripts' entry points in the `pyprojects.toml` file.

## How to use

### Running the application

The `sensemon` application is designed to run unsupervised, and it will collect and upload data until it is interrupted by some external event (e.g. keyboard interrup, process `kill` command, etc.)

To launch this application from terminal:

```bash
$ nohup python -u sensemon.py > sensemon.out &
```

This command launches the `sensemon` application in the background. The application will keep running even after the terminal window is closed. Any output will be redirected to the `sensemon.out` file.

It's also possible to install this application via `pip` from Github, and one then can launch the application as follows:

```bash
$ nohup sensemon > sensemon.out &
```

### Interacting with the application

The `sensemon` application can read settings from both a `settings.toml` file and from CLI arguments:

```bash
# Use CLI arg '-h' to see available options
$ sensemon -h 

# Stop after 10 uploads
$ sensemon --uploads 10

# Show 'progress bar' regardless of setting in 'toml' file
$ sensemon --progress

# Show specific display mode (e.g. 'temperature') regardless 
# of setting in 'toml' file
$ sensemon --dmode temperature
```

The format of the `settings.toml` file is straight forward and this is also where you should store Adafruit IO credentials. The `settings.toml` file only supports numbers and strings. But you define most aspects of the applications here.

For example, if you change the `PROGRESS` setting to 1, then the Sense HAT LED will display a progress bar indicating when the next (simulated) upload will happen.

There is also a 'sleep mode' which turns off the display automatically after a certain amount of time. You can also turn on/off the LED display by pushing/tapping the joystick button (down).

```toml
# File: settings.toml
...
PROGRESS = 1    # [0|1] - 1 = show upload progress bar on LED
SLEEP = 600     # Delay in seconds until screen is blanked
...
```

Please refer to the section "*Custom application settings in SETTINGS.TOML*" below for more information on available options in the `settings.toml` file.

The `sensemon` application can display live data both in the terminal and on the Sense HAT LED. If you do no want to see any output in the termin (e.g. if you want to run the application in the background), the you can start the application with the `--noCLI` flag. Similarly, the `--noLED` flag prevents any output to the Sense HAT LED.

This application offers 4 different display modes for the Sense HAT LED:

- *temperature* â€” show realtime graph of current temperature data
- *pressure* â€” show realtime graph of current baromteric pressure data
- *humidity* â€” show realtime graph of current humidity data
- *sparkles* â€” show random pixels light up â€” looks great at night and lets you know the app is running ðŸ˜‰

You can switch between display modes by pushing the Sense HAT joystick left or right, and you can rotate the display by pushing up or down. You can also turn the LED display on/off by tapping (pushing straight down) the joystick in the middle.

Finally you can exit the application using the `ctrl-c` command. If you use the `--uploads N` commandline argument, then the application will stop after *N* (simulated) uploads.

## How to test

**NOTE: THIS IS STILL W.I.P - MORE/BETTER TEST TO COME**

The tests are written for [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/contents.html) and we use markers to separate out tests that require the actual Sense HAT hardware. Some tests do not rely on the hardware to be prexent. However, those tests rely on the `pytest-mock` module to be present.

```bash
# Run all tests (except marked 'skip')
$ pytest

# Run tests with 'hardware' marker
$ pytest -m "hardware"

# Run tests without 'hardware' marker
$ pytest -m "not hardware"
```

## Custom application settings in SETTINGS.TOML

The 'settings.toml' file holds various custom application settings and secrets (e.g. Adafruit IO keys, etc.) and this file should **NOT** be included in 'git' commits.

It is recommended to copy the '*settings.example*' to '*settings.toml*' and then customize the values in '*settings.toml*' as nedeed for the specific device that the application is running on.

### Adafruit IO settings

- **AIO_USERNAME**: 'string' - Adafruit IO username
- **AIO_KEY**: 'string' - Adafruit IO key
- **AIO_UPLOAD**: 'string' - yes | force | no
  - "yes" - *upload if feed available*
  - "force" - *exit if feed invalid*
  - "no" - *do not upload data*

- **FEED_TEMPS**: 'string' - Adafruit IO feed key for 'temperature' feed
- **FEED_PRESS**: 'string' - Adafruit IO feed key for 'pressure' feed
- **FEED_HUMID**: 'string' - Adafruit IO feed key for 'humidity' feed

### Misc. Settings for Data Management

- **UNITS_TEMPS**: 'string' - temperature sensor reads in "C", but data can also be converted to other units for display and upload.
  - "C" - *Celsius*
  - "F" - *Fahrenheit - data will be converted from Celsius to Fahrenheit*
  - "K" - *Kelvin - data will be converted from Celsius to Kelvin*

  - *Example: "F" means temperature data will be converted from Celsius to Fahrenheit before it is uploaded or displayed.*

**NOTE:** THIS SETTING IS RESERVED FOR FUTURE USE

  - 0 | 180 - *top of LED will point away/toward RPI USB*

- **DISPLAY**: 'str'
  - 'name_of_display_mode' - *name of display mode with single data point (e.g. temperature, etc.) and scrolling bar graph*
